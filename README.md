# Should I Go Outside Now
An app that makes of the Google Places API to tell you when the least risky time to do errands is during the COVID-19 outbreak

### Getting Started

**📁 places-api**

The API that the native app uses lives under places-api. See the README.md that lives in the directory to understand how to set that up

I had to create this as a github submodule in order to be able to deploy to Heroku whilst also having the code live as a part of this repo. 

The app currently lives at https://corona-errands-helper.herokuapp.com

**📁 client**

The react-native application that reads from the places api.
