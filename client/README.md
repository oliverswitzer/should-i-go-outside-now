# Getting Started

* yarn install
* install Android Studio
  * install an Android SDK (Tools > Android > SDK Manager)
  * install an Android Simulator (Tools > Android > AVD Manager) 
* install the latest version of XCode
* create your own version of `.env.sample`

Then to run either iOS or Android in development:

```bash
cd android
yarn start
```

```bash
cd ios
yarn start
```

Both of these commands should open a simulator running the app code.
